Network manager do not allow one to globally switch off 
automatic connection to wifi networks, although they do allow
you to switch off automatic connections on a per network basis.

This script hackily allows you to do the former using the latter.

If you periodically run this command as root, it rewrites your
configuration files so that they don't auto connect.

Tested with 0.9.8.8-0ubuntu7
